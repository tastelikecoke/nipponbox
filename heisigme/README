Instructions:
insert keyword; get kanji.

separate each keyword with commas to make compound words,like this:
	spirit,hold,chi,bad,i

this would be processed as:
	気持ち悪い

The text in the box is separated from the commas, then each of them is
matched to a dictionary stored in the data.js.  In case there is no
match, we use the difflib.js module (http://qiao.github.io/difflib.js/)
to do autocomplete magic.

heisigme.py is the original non-js script.

If anyone is actually reading this, I do have questions how to attribute
works from github and how this whole git thing works in general. So
please help me on my journey :)
